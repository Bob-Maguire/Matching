# Matching
## A Self-Imposed Coding Project
This is designed so I can pick back up my coding skills. Using C++ I will be creating
a barebones matching engine. Mostly because I want to. C++ is good because if you
need a lot of things to be matched quickly I'd much rather have a compiled language
compared to something interpretive like Python or interpretive dance.

### match.cpp
More of a testing file, probably will not end up in the final version (if there
ever is a final version).
